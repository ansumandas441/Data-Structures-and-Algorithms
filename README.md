# Data Structures and Algorithms
This respository is a collection of readable and clean implementation of data structures and algorithms in JAVA, C++ and Python. This is a work in progress, so some algorithms may not be included. You can find the optimised solution to 500+ popular problems from Leetcode, Geeksforgeeks, Interviewbit etc. 
If you have any questions, requests, or find any error in the provided solutions, please don't hesitate to contact me. If you find this repository helpful, I would like to know :) 

P.S. Each programming language folder has its own table of contents.
